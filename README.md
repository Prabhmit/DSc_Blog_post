# Installations and package requirement
The code is in Python 3.7.6 in Jupyter notebook. The Python libraries that have been are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and collections. The Anaconda distribution of Python covers the above requirements. 

# Project Motivation
I was interested to explore Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey data from 2011 to 2020 to discover /understand trends in Computer Science: 
1.	Is there a trend in participant country representation from 2011 to 2020?
2.	Is there a trend in participant representation from non-computer science disciplines especially fine arts, health science or natural science?
3.	Which are the top five popular programming languages since 2011?

# File Descriptions
The Project1.ipynb file contains the necessary scripts to read, cleanse, filter/join and analyze the data for this project. There are ten csv datafiles for Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey data from 2011 to 2020 which are included in the Stack Overflow Survey Results zip file. The following are files names for the yearly survey data in their own individual directory. The files are also accessible via the below links:
