# Installations and package requirement
The code is in Python 3.7.6 in Jupyter notebook. The Python libraries applied are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and collections. The Anaconda distribution of Python covers the above requirements. 

# Project Motivation
I have explored Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey data from 2011 to 2020 to discover /understand trends in Computer Science to answer following: 
1.	Is there a trend in participant country representation from 2011 to 2020?
2.	Is there a trend in participant representation from non-computer science disciplines especially fine arts, health science or natural science?
3.	Have the top five popular programming languages changed from year to year since 2011?

# File Descriptions
The Project1.ipynb file contains the necessary scripts to read, cleanse, filter/join and analyze the data for this project. There are ten csv datafiles for Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey data from 2011 to 2020 which are included in the Stack Overflow Survey Results zip-folder. 2011 and 2012 csv files were opened and converted in Notepad++ to utf-8 codec first. The files in the zip-folder are ready to be used with Project1.ipynb file. 

The raw files if required are at: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/surve

The following are directory and survey data file names for data files contained in the Stack Overflow Survey Results zip-folder:

2011 Stack Overflow Survey Results -> 2011 Stack Overflow Survey Results.csv

2012 Stack Overflow Survey Results -> 2012 Stack Overflow Survey Results.csv 

2013 Stack Overflow Survey Responses -> 2013 Stack Overflow Survey Responses.csv

2014 Stack Overflow Survey Responses -> 2014 Stack Overflow Survey Responses.csv

2015 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Responses -> 2015 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Responses.csv

2016 Stack Overflow Survey Results -> 2016 Stack Overflow Survey Responses.csv 

developer_survey_2017 -> survey_results_public.cs

developer_survey_2018 -> survey_results_public.csv

developer_survey_2019 -> survey_results_public.csv

developer_survey_2020 -> survey_results_public.csv
